# Java_Interview_Questions
miscellany code typically asked in an interview

I know the purpose of these type of questions is to be able to answer basic questions on the spot, but when being interviewed sometimes I get a bit of stage fright and forget how to spell my own name, let alone calculate pi to the 1,000th place.

These are just simple programs.
